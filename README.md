# Three.js Experiments

I experimented with Three.js to become more familiar with the library.

## Projects:
- **Plane:** users can adjust the width, height, width segments, and height segments of the plane object. Users can also use their mouse to rotate the object.
- **Jagged Plane:** users can adjust the width, height, width segments, and height segments of the jagged plane object. Users can also use their mouse to rotate the object.
- **Cube:** users can adjust the width, height, and depth of the cube object. Users can also use their mouse to rotate the object.
